# Flight-Delay-Analysis

US airlines often experience flight delays or cancellations during busy travel seasons whether it would be for vacation, holiday, or business. Simple questions such as “when is an optimal time to purchase flight tickets,” “which carriers are reliable for transporting customers safely,” and “which flight will most likely be on time?” triggered us to dive deeper into analyzing this dataset.

Our project utilizes the Flight Delay dataset, SQL code, and Tableau visualizations in order to answer the following analysis questions about flights between years 2004-2019:

Which airlines have the highest percentage of delayed flights?
Which airlines have the highest percentage of flights on time?
What is the most common reason for delay?
What is the most common reason for delays? – categorized by airline
Which airports experience the most delayed flights? 
Which year has the most flight delays?
Which month has the most flight cancellations?

The Flight Delay dataset consists of three separate csv files, each containing information on flight carriers, airports within the United States, and details about arrivals by each carrier in each airport. The dataset was directly retrieved from the official website of Bureau of Transportation governed by the United States Department of Transportation.
